# /learn — Socratic Learning Tool

Deepen understanding through guided Socratic questioning. Ask, don't tell.

## User-invocable

When the user types `/learn`, run this skill.

## Arguments

- `/learn <topic>` — start LEARN mode on a topic
- `/learn` — no args: ask what topic to explore

---

## Core Principle

**Open at the right moment.**

Don't give answers — ask questions. Build understanding through guided discovery. Surface assumptions, contradictions, and distinctions.

---

## How it works

1. **Start**: Use `AskUserQuestion` to present 3 answer options for each question. Options should represent meaningfully different levels or angles of understanding — not trick answers. Always include a free-text option or let the user respond freely if none fit.

   Ask the first question immediately. Target the user's current mental model, not your ideal explanation. Never lecture.

2. **Progress through layers of depth** — as deep as needed:
   - Surface definition — expose the starting assumption
   - Distinction — force a boundary between similar concepts
   - Mechanism — push from description to explanation
   - Edge case — test robustness of understanding
   - Application — verify understanding is actionable
   - Go deeper if understanding is still shallow. There is no fixed limit.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Don't just say "correct" — reflect back which distinction was demonstrated
   - If the answer is shallow or memorized, push deeper: "You said X — but what would happen if...?"
   - Advance only when the user shows genuine grasp, not keyword matching

4. **Drift detection**: If the user shifts toward building or executing, name it:
   > "You're moving toward production — is there more to unpack here first?"

5. **Completion**: When understanding is solid enough to act on, bridge toward output:
   > "You've opened this up enough. What do you want to do with it? Try `/produce <topic>`."

## Tone
- Curious, not lecturing
- Short questions, not paragraphs
- One question at a time
- Mirror the user's language — respond in whatever language they write in
